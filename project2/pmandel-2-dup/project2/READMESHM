Simple application to demonstrate organizing an MxM array of integers within a shared memory block. Two files: shmsrv.c shmcli.c

Invocation: ./shmsrv

Server creates shared memory segment to hold the array.
The block contains integer pointers followed by the rows of integer values.
Comments in shmsrv.c describe the array layout in more detail.

Parent uses fork/exec to run shmcli.  This client fills in the array.

Parent waits for the child to finish and then prints out the values stored by the child.

There are other approaches to creating the 2D array of integers.  You are not required to use this approach.

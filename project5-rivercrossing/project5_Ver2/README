b) While the boat is crossing the river, no one can jump on and get off the
boat.
c) Everyone on the boat has been registered properly. More precisely, no
one who was not registered can be on the boat.
d) No one who is on the boat for a crossing can come back and register for
another crossing before the current boat load completes
